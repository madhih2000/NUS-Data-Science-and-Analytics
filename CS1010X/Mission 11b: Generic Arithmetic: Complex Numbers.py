# Task 1 #
##########

# With these operations, compound generic operations can be defined, such as
# def square(x):
#   return mul(x, x)

# (a) What are the types of the input and output of the generic square operation?
# Answer: input: Generic-Num
#         output: Generic-Num

# (b) Why would we prefer to define square in the above way, rather than:
# def square(x):
#    return apply_generic("square", x)
# Answer: Creating a new operator 'square' would require the programmer to create a new square function for
#         every existing number package. This is unnecessary work which can be simplified by using the existing
#         multiply function in all packages.

##########
# Task 2 #
##########
# In the ordinary number package, a generic number operator is indexed by the
# name of the operator and a tuple of strings. For example, the add operator is
# indexed by ’add_ord’ and (’ordinary’, ’ordinary’); negation is indexed by
# ’negate_ord’ and (’ordinary’, ).
# In contrast, the constructor that creates an ordinary number is indexed by
# ’make_ord’ and just a string ’ordinary’. Explain why we have such a difference.

# Hint: Consider the differences in the process of the creation of a Generic-Num,
# such as create_ordinary, and the operations we can apply on Generic-Num, such
# as add. How is make_ord invoked, and how is add_ord invoked?

# Answer: When a generic operator is called, it runs the operator and generic numbers through the apply_generic function.
#         The apply_generic function uses a map function to retrieve the tag from the generic number, and converts it into a tuple.
#         Thus, negation for example, is indexed by ('ordinary',). However, the constructor does not call apply_generic, and thus does
#         not create a tuple out of the string 'ordinary'.

##########
# Task 3 #
##########

# There’s a right way and a wrong way to create a generic complex number. Here are two tries at
# producing 9+10i. Which is the right way?

# first_try = create_complex(9, 10)
# second_try = create_complex(create_ordinary(9), create_ordinary(10))

# What happens when you use the wrong way to produce 9+10i and 3+10i and then try to add
# them? Why does this happen?

# Right way: second_try
# What happens: Exception: ('Bad tagged datum -- type_tag ', 9)
# Why it happens: The operators in the complex number package make use of the generic operators in the generic number package to perform the
#                 arithmetic on the real and imaginary parts. Since the generic operators call on apply_generic which requires the numbers
#                 to be tagged, first_try fails as 9 and 10 are untagged.

# Task 4 #
##########

# Produce expressions that define c2_plus_7i to be the generic complex number whose real part is 2
# and whose imaginary part is 7, and c3_plus_1i to be the generic complex number whose real part
# is 3 and whose imaginary part is 1. Assume that the expression
# >>> csq = square(sub(c2_plus_7i, c3_plus_1i))
# is evaluated. Draw a box and pointer diagram that represents csq.

# As an example, the following is a box and pointer diagram that represents x, a Generic-
# Ord number:
# x = create_ordinary(5)
#
#         +---+---+---+---+
# x  -->  |       |       |
#         +---+---+---+---+
#             |       |
#             v       v
#         "ordinary"  5

# FILL IN YOUR ANSWERS HERE:
# c2_plus_7i = create_complex(create_ordinary(2), create_ordinary(7))
# c3_plus_1i = create_complex(create_ordinary(3), create_ordinary(1))

# csq = square(sub(c2_plus_7i, c3_plus_1i))

# Task 5 #
##########

# Within the generic complex number package, the internal add_com function
# handled the addition operation. Why is it not
# possible to name this function "add"?

# Answer: add_com makes a call to the generic function 'add' from the generic number package, in its return statement. If add_com were to be named add,
#         it would cause it to call itself, which would result in an error.
