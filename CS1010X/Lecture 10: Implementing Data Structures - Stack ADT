Question 1

A stack is an abstract data type that accepts and returns data in a Last In First Out manner. Data that is added in last will be taken out first. Imagine putting chips into a Pringles can. As you stack chips in the can, the first chip put in ends up at the bottom and the last chip will sit at the top. To take out one chip, you have to take the top most chip.

Suppose we start with an empty stack and put the following numbers into it, from left to right: 4, 3, 2, 1. What value is at the top of the stack?

Ans:

1

Question 2

There are two important operations that a stack must support: push and pop.

To add items to the stack, we push them onto the stack, and to get the top element from the stack, we pop it off the stack.



Which sequence(s) of push and pop operations will result in the following stack?
3 <-- top
2
1 <-- bottom

Ans:

push 1 push 2 pop push 2 push 3

push 1 push 2 push 3

Question 3: Making the Stack

Now that we understand the behaviour of a stack a little better, we can try to implement it.

A stack can be implemented using a list, where the first element in the list is at the bottom of the stack and the last element is at the top of the stack. For the following questions, we shall assume that stacks are implemented in the manner just mentioned.

Define a constructor make_stack(seq) for a stack that takes in a sequence and returns a stack representation of the sequence where the last element in the sequence is at the top of stack and the first element is the bottom of the stack.

Define another constructor make_empty_stack() that takes no arguments and returns an empty stack. Can you use make_stack here?

In addition, define the following predicate function is_empty_stack(stack) that returns True if the stack is empty and False otherwise.

Ans:

def make_stack(seq):
    s = make_empty_stack()
    for i in seq:
        s.append(i)
    return s

def make_empty_stack():
    return []

def is_empty_stack(stack):
    if not stack:
        return True
    else:
        return False

s1 = make_empty_stack()                  #

                                         #
is_empty1 = is_empty_stack(s1) #True	 #
is_empty2 = is_empty_stack(s2) #False	 #
is_empty3 = is_empty_stack(s3) #False    #

Question 4: Stacking like Jenga

Now implement the modifiers push_stack(stack, item) and pop_stack(stack).
push_stack takes in a stack and an item and pushes the item onto the top of the stack.
pop_stack takes in a stack, removes the top item of that stack, and returns that top item. If the stack is empty, return None.

Note: Push and pop actions have to modify the stack itself!

Ans:

def push_stack(stack, item):
    # pushes an item onto the stack, returns the stack
    stack.append(item)
    return stack # your code here

def pop_stack(stack):
    # removes the top item of the stack, returns that item. If the stack is empty, it should return None.
    if not stack:
        return None
    else:
        item = stack.pop()
    return item

s = make_empty_stack()                   #
first = pop_stack(s) #None               #

push_stack(s, 1)                         #
push_stack(s, 2)                         #
                                         #
second = pop_stack(s) #2                 #
third = pop_stack(s)  #1                 #
push_stack(s, 3)                         #
fourth = pop_stack(s) #3                 #

Question 5: Added Functionality

We now have all the functions we actually need to work with stacks. Two additional functions that would be nice are the accessor peek and modifier clear_stack functions.

peek(stack) returns, but does not remove, the top element from a stack. In other words, it behaves like pop(stack) with the exception that the top element is not removed.

clear_stack(stack) modifies the given stack, makes it empty and returns the stack

Define these functions.

Ans:

def peek_stack(stack):
    # returns but does not remove the top element of the stack. If the stack is empty, it should return None.
    if len(stack) == 0:
        return None
        
    else:
        return stack[-1]
    
def clear_stack(stack):
    stack.clear()
    return stack

s1 = make_empty_stack()                  #
s2 = make_stack((2, 4, 5))               #
                                         #
peek1 = peek_stack(s1) #None             #
peek2 = peek_stack(s2) #5                #
                                         #
clear_stack(s2)                          #
peek3 = peek_stack(s2) #None             #

Question 6: The postfix expression

Now that we have our own implementation of a stack, we should put it to good use. A stack can be used to calculate the result of mathematical expressions.

In conventional mathematics, we often use infix notation. For this question, we will be using postfix notation. In postfix notation, operators are placed at the back of the operands rather than in the middle. Operators are assumed to be binary operators.

We will use tuples to represent mathematical expressions. For example, the following infix expressions can be expressed in postfix notation as:
(1, '+', 2) in postfix will be (1, 2, '+')
((1, '+', 25), '*', 3) in postfix will be (1, 25, '+', 3, '*')
(3, '*', (1, '+', 2))' in postfix will be (3, 1, 2, '+', '*')

If you have trouble with the 3rd example, imagine infix notation as a binary tree structure where the root is the operator, the left operand is the left subtree and the right operand is the right subtree. The postfix notation can be derived by concatenating the postfix notation of the left subtree with the postfix notation of the right subtree and the root operator. If a subtree is a leaf node, then it's postfix notation is just itself.

You can safely assume the following:
The operators used are only binary operators: '+', '-', '*', '/'
All inputs are valid math expressions.
Expressions for 2 operands and operators in the input are always wrapped in a tuple to ensure there is no ambiguity in execution

Now let's calculate the postfix form expressions. The calculate function takes in a math expression in postfix tuple form and returns the result of the entire expression as an integer (the final result is guaranteed to be an integer).

You can calculate the expression using the following algorithm:
If the expression only contains an integer, return that integer. Otherwise, maintain a stack.
Loop through the tuple and push every element to the stack, unless the element is an operator. If the element is an operator, pop the first two elements out of the stack (the first and second elements popped will be the right and left operands respectively), calculate the result and push the result into the stack.

To illustrate, we take the example (1, 2, '+', 3, '*') below (the stack is initially empty):
  a. take 1, push 1                                         # stack is [1]
  b. take 2, push 2                                         # stack is [1, 2]
  c. take '+', pop 2, pop 1, calculate 1 + 2 = 3, push 3    # stack is [3]
  d. take 3, push 3                                         # stack is [3, 3]
  e. take '*', pop 3, pop 3, calculate 3 * 3 = 9, push 9    # stack is [9]
  f. input empty, pop 9, return 9

You may assume that all inputs are valid expressions.

The functions listed below are provided for your usage. You do NOT have to implement it in your answer!
make_empty_stack()
make_stack(seq) 
is_empty_stack(stack) 
peek_stack(stack)
push_stack(stack, item)
pop_stack(stack)
clear_stack(stack)


Ans:


def calculate(tup):
    stack=list()
    if len(tup)==1 and tup[0] is int:
        return tup[0]
    for i in tup:
        if type(i) is int:
            stack.append(i)
        elif i in ["+","-","*","/"]:
            if i is "+":
                stack.append(stack[-1]+stack[-2])
            elif i is "-":
                stack.append(stack[-2]-stack[-1])
            elif i is "*":
                stack.append(stack[-1]*stack[-2])
            elif i is "/":
                stack.append(stack[-2]/stack[-1])
            stack.pop(-2)
            stack.pop(-2)
    return int(stack[0])
