Question 1

Jon the Juggler demonstrates a five ball cascade:

ball1, ball2, ball3, ball4, ball5 = 'red', 'green', 'blue', 'red', 'blue'
ball1, ball2, ball3, ball4, ball5 = ball4, ball2, ball5, ball1, ball3
ball1, ball2, ball3, ball4, ball5 = ball5, ball1, ball2, ball3, ball4
What is the color of ball5?

Ans:

red

Question 2

def bool_eval(x):
    return True if x else False
def str_eval(x):
    return 'True' if x else 'False'
Which of the following expressions return the boolean True when evaluated?

Note: Although the string True and the boolean True are different, print('True') and print(True) produces output that is indistinguishable.

Ans:

bool_eval('True')
str_eval(bool_eval(False)) == 'False'
bool_eval(str_eval(str_eval(False)))

Question 3

cube_a = 2 ** 3
cube_b = 2 ** 3
cube_c = lambda x: x ** 3
cube_d = lambda x: x ** 3
cube_e = lambda x: cube_d
cube_f = lambda cube_d: cube_d
def cube_g(cube_a):
    def cube_h(cube_a):
        return cube_a ** 3
    return cube_h
Which of the following evaluates to True?

Ans:

cube_a == cube_b
cube_c(2) == cube_d(2)
cube_d == cube_e(2)
cube_c(cube_a) == cube_a ** 3
cube_g(3)(5) = 5 ** 3

Question 4

This question is a code-tracing practice. Please trace the code manually before verifying the answers using IDLE.

def foo(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return 2 * n + foo(n - 1)
What is the value of foo(5)?

Ans:

30

Question 5

This question is a code-tracing practice. Please trace the code manually before verifying the answers using IDLE.

def bar(n):
    if n < 3:
        return n + 1
    else:
        return bar(n - 3) + bar(n - 2) + bar(n - 1) 
What is the value of bar(4)?

Ans:

11

Question 6

This question is a code-tracing practice. Please trace the code manually before verifying the answers using IDLE.

Yeti wants to climb a 40 cubit gravel knoll. Unfortunately, the gravel is loose and Yeti's footing slips occasionally.

def hike(current_altitude):
    if current_altitude > 40:
        return 0
    else:
        return 1 + slide(current_altitude + 11)

def slide(current_altitude):
    if current_altitude > 40:
        return 0
    else:
        return hike(current_altitude - 3)

n = hike(0)

Yeti takes n steps to climb from the bottom of the hill to the top. What is n?

Ans:

5

Question 7

Yeti wants to climb a 40 cubit gravel knoll. Unfortunately, the gravel is loose and Yeti's footing slips occasionally.


def hike(current_altitude):
    if current_altitude > 40:
        return 0
    else:
        return 1 + slide(current_altitude + 11)

def slide(current_altitude):
    if current_altitude > 40:
        return 0
    else:
        return hike(current_altitude - 3)

Which of the following can be considered as magic numbers?

Ans:

40
11
3
